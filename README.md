1. Know your LLM environment (data privacy: chat storage; usage stats; licenses)
2. Using a "stream of consciousness" prompt with rough spelling, grammar, but with the who, what, when, where, why, and how
3. Take advantage of system prompts and meta prompts (focusing or directing the LLM)
4. A/B'ing LLMs against each other for fault tolerance and groundedness
5. Accept the fact you'll never be caught up. Instead, look around, ask questions, test
6. Flex the LLM's multi-modal muscles
7. Speaking of muscles: Cognitive muscle memory with gen AI
8.

## Tim's Rules of LLM Prompting

- Any information you omit from your prompt will be inferred by the AI.
- Never give personal or confidential information to a public / free AI. Be aware!
- Maintain at least 2 "daily driver" LLMs at a paid tier for AB testing
- Speak to the LLM in the ways that are most comfortable (voice, text, image)
- Think in terms of meta prompting (optimizing your custom instructions; asking AI for a summary prompt)
- Apply a stream-of-consciousness technique to generate prompts
- Be on the lookout for signs of amnesia/hallucination and have a backup plan
- Don't forget to attribute AI enrichment
- Understand the particularities of each LLM and leverage them in multi-chat sessions
